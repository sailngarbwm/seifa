abstract = {Summary The \$20m Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN) project (www.aurin.org.au) began in July 2010. AURIN has been tasked with developing a secure, Web-based virtual environment (e-Infrastructure) offering seamless, secure access to diverse, distributed and extremely heterogeneous data sets from numerous agencies with an extensive portfolio of targeted analytical and visualization tools. This is being provisioned for Australia-wide urban and built environment researchers – itself a highly heterogeneous collection of research communities with diverse demands, through a unified urban research gateway. This paper describes these demands and how the e-Infrastructure and gateway is being designed and implemented to accommodate this diversity of requirements, both from the user/researcher perspective and from the data provider perspective. The scaling of the infrastructure is presented and the way in which it copes with the spectrum of big data challenges (volume, veracity, variability and velocity) and associated big data analytics. The utility of the e-Infrastructure is also demonstrated through a range of scenarios illustrating and reflecting the interdisciplinary urban research now possible.

abstract = {Dataframes are a popular abstraction to represent, prepare, and analyze data. Despite the remarkable success of dataframe libraries in R and Python, dataframes face performance issues even on moderately large datasets. Moreover, there is significant ambiguity regarding dataframe semantics. In this paper we lay out a vision and roadmap for scalable dataframe systems. To demonstrate the potential in this area, we report on our experience building Modin, a scaled-up implementation of the most widely-used and complex dataframe API today, Python's pandas. With pandas as a reference, we propose a simple data model and algebra for dataframes to ground discussion in the field. Given this foundation, we lay out an agenda of open research opportunities where the distinct features of dataframes will require extending the state of the art in many dimensions of data management. We discuss the implications of signature dataframe features including flexible schemas, ordering, row/column equivalence, and data/metadata fluidity, as well as the piecemeal, trial-and-error-based approach to interacting with dataframes.},
